Requirements: 
- Install Apache Ant
- Install JDK version 1.8.xxx


Deliverables:
- The file “gmprocess.exe” in the folder “Compiler” is the compiler of the GummyJ language
- The folder “Examples” contains two examples, “TrafficCongestion” represents emergent gummy modules, and “Remote File Management System” represents composite gummy modules that can explicitly be instantiated.
- The folder “lib” contains the required jar files, including the backend of GummyJ language.
- The folder “src_gm” is used by Ant to read the desired “.gm” file and compile it to Java files.
- The folder “src_generated” will be generated by Ant and contains the generated Java files.


To run an example:
- Put your GummyJ script file, which have “.gm” extension, into the folder "src_gm" of your GummyJ main folder
- In your GummyJ main folder, run "ant bin-generate"
- The generated files will be located in the src_generated


To Run the generated files:
- Create a normal Java project, and put the generated files in it.
- Each example is shipped with a “Test.java” that generates events and tests the example. Add this file to your project.
- Add a reference to the Jar files in the “lib” folder
- Run the “Test” file.
